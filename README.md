# Udemy SQL Course
To start learning SQL, I'm working through an introductory SQL course. The course is titled "The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp: Go from SQL Beginner to Expert", and can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/).

## CRUD Basics
The first 7 sections in this course cover what they call "CRUD operations", which is Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting elements in the database. In the 7th course, labeled "CRUD Challenge", I've been assigned the following:
 - Create a database, shirts.db, and populate it with a shirts table including the provided data.
 - Add to the shirts table a medium purple polo shirt last worn 50 days ago.
 - Select all of the shirts, but only print out the article and color.
 - Select all medium shirts, and print out all info except the primary key.
 - Update all polo shirts to be size L.
 - Update the shirt last work 15 days ago to be worn 0 days ago.
 - Update all white shirts to be size XS with off-white color.
 - Delete all shirts last worn 200 days ago.
 - Delete all tank tops
 - Delete all shirts (Catastrophe!)
 - Delete the entire shirts table (AAAAAHHH!!)

## String Functions
The next section covers some important string functions that are used to modify the outputs. For the whole course, we use example data from a bookstore. At the top of this file, we have the introductory practice and explanations of each function. At the end, we have the final exercises and my solutions.
